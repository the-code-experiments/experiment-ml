    "What is feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Feature or variable selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features from a total features available in a dataset to build ML algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why should we select features?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Its easy to understand the output which uses 10 variables as compare to 100 variables. Thus, simple models are easier to interpret.\n",
    "* Shorter training times.\n",
    "* Reduce the risk of data errors during model use.\n",
    "* Reduce the variable redundancy. Exclude co-related variables.\n",
    "* Bad learning behaviour in high dimensional space."
